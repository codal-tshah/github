GIT and Github

first have to connect with github by using vcommand in git bash 

connect : username and email

commands : 
git config --global user.name -----
git config --global user.email -----

to check the connected github username or email 
commands:
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

1) make any folder inside it create a files if want then just paste that directory path in git bash 
2) now u are good to go foor ahead such as start by commands 
commands :
git init - to initialize the the repo
git add . - to add all the files 
git commit -m "" - it will commit the files with individual message (-m stands for message)
git status - check the status of files which are modified or not yet commited in tree
git log  - to check all the comits time individually 
git restore --staged <filename>  - if you have added the file in add and dont want to commit it further than restore it by this command
git reset <commit id> - if u want to remove the stages of commit just take a commit id above from all commits will be gone 
git stash -  its used whenever we want to do some work and want to save it for later to see and backup without even commit in branch it will just make a backup file (just make files do git add . and then git stash to save for later all that files)
git stash pop - use to pop all that stash files u make for backup
git stash clear - its just clear up all that files u used for backup and remove it
